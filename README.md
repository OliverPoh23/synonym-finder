# Synonym Chaser App

<!--I am Software Dev. Diploma candidate at Code Institute. For my second project on interactive front-end development, I made a Thesaurus web application. The project commenced in early December 2020, with two months before a Feb 2020 deadline. Right before Christmas, I began wireframing the things I wanted a Thesaurus to do.  I use Thesaurus.com often, for everything. I am by all means the user in my mind as I was developing the project. Let's see: I wanted a simple Thesaurus with one key differnce : the ability to have a larger overview of my "search session"... so that it's almost like I had been taking notes the whole time, in a way. I wasn't certain what that fully meant yet until I really learned JavaScript. For this project, I dove deep into the language. By new year, I was fully up to speed with React hooks and stateful components. Writing this now, barely a month and a half later, I can barely remember consciousness without JSX and React. The "overview" aka interactive Thesaurus feature was essentially a "saved list" of queries in a search session. Simple right? I started looking at it like a products list and a shopping cart -- for which there are enough references and examples to troubleshoot with as the project got more complicated, and moved into testing, etc. (which made me feel safer). Today I'm still pretty impressed that I got most of this working. Nothing compares to the many aha moments I had building this project. From Code Institute's IFD module to the relatively few React sources, I was able to go all the way pretty effectively. Some of what I wish to implement is deep merging the history, or some idea of what to do with a session's data. But I guess that's coming in Data Centric front end (next). Thanks for reading!-->

<!--getting the JSON response to "stick" (mount) was my biggest challenge. server side props, calling on change, etc. lots of "undefined".  The API's response is deeply deeply nested. I wanted to focus my attention on this and not get distracted with design. And Material UI came in handy for this. as they are react components. I went throguh a version of the project.-->
<!--The first time i got the reducer to work was magic. Coz all i did was follow the logic of the function. Stateful components are magic.!!!-->

<!--jsconsole, json testing.-->

SynonymSearch is as an interactive Thesaurus that tracks and sorts a history of all search queries leading up to the current one. Using React reducer and context hooks, the app's Saved List tab functions as a shopping cart with a list of items saved (queried) from dynamic Results -- a list of products.

SynonymSEARCH with Merriam-Webster's Thesaurus: How to retain all queried words during a thesaurus search session.
Sustain meaning by having a persistent overview of your search impulses with this reliable and interactive Thesaurus. Our progressive iteration of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus is built by developers at Code Institute to bridge the missing gap between sessions: a tool that is five steps ahead of the user's impulses.

This project is developed as part of MS2 Interactive Front End module at Code Institute. It is written to work with [Thesaurus API]() 's JSON response format, and is developed with [React]() via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment))

## Features
___
### Existing Features
___

#### Search
___

  - The app utilizes Axios to manage responses from the API. The app's Search component is written to auto-cancel in the middle of typing so as to reduce the amount of requests to the API.  The Search component is built from Material-UI input elements and uses State hooks elicit *side-effects* `onSearchTextChange`.

#### Results ( the products )
___
###### [View Schematic Results Component Ideation Board](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/public/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes11.jpg?raw=true)

  - The Results component is programmed to showcase all Synonyms, Related Words, Synonymous Phrases, and Similar Words deeply nested in each of many definitions of all words matching the queried *searchText*.
  - Clicking any of the words in Results adds that word to a Saved-List session ([via Context API and Reducer hooks](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)), produces new results from that word, and so on. The Results component is written to work specifically with the JSON response from the Thesaurus API.
- To note, on succinctly representing the API response:
  - Each query has several head-words ("about" as preposition, as adverb...):
    - Each headWord has several definitions ("about" as in to be, "about as in to...):
      - Each headWord defined in a particular way has:
        - A definition.
        - A string that uses the word in a sentence ([see Display String](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment))
        - A list of Synonyms
        - A list of Related words
        - A list of Synonymous Phrases
        - A list of Similar Words
- The Results component is essentially a wrapper to showcase the words as packaged options.
-  Component Sub Features:
   -  Ability to see if and how many times a word has been queried before.
   -  Ability to see if and how many words have been queried with the same definition.
   -  Ability to see if and how many definitions queried share the same root.
   -  Ability to match definition in a string (See Display String).

#### Display String ( the preview )
___
###### [View Schematic Display Component Ideation Board 1](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/public/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes27.jpg?raw=true)

###### [View Schematic Display Component Ideation Board 2](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/public/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes28.jpg?raw=true)

  -  The app offers the ability to "test" or "preview" how interchangeable or synonymous a word is relative to its definition. Much like previewing sizes, matches, colors in a list of products while shopping, the Display String offers a user's own subjective understanding of a word to determine further searching within a word's particular definition (clicking, `onSelectionChange`) or starting a new search (typing, `onSearchTextChange`).

#### Saved List ( the cart )
___
###### [View Schematic Saved Selections Component Ideation Board](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/public/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes12.jpg?raw=true)
  -  Each saved word instance retains properties of the Results family it is "taken" from -- such as the word's particular definition, label, root word -- to increment values of duplicates and group words by sense definitions while ensuring each instance, no matter identical at name value, is distinct if the definition and sense is different.
-  Component Sub Features:
   -  Ability to remove individual words from the list.
   -  Ability to clear the list.

#### Counters Context ( and useReducer )
___
  -  Text about `wordsHistoryDispatch`

#### Theme Context ( and useMemo, useMediaQuery )
___
- Text about theme provider

## Credits
___
### Code
___

- Damien L. Gilliams' tutorial on [how to embed LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.damosdesigns.com/LinkedinRecommendationsOnWebsite/) takes care of a whole section in the project, and is a great lesson on appropriation. Directly following Mr. Gilliams' tutorial, the style block for `#target-six`'s Recommendations section in style.css are only slightly modified from the tutorial. This style block includes Mr. Gilliams' original comments.  Equally, the code in index.html for the Recommendations section is taken from the owner's public LinkedIn profile, with adjustments per Mr. Gilliams' tutorial. One adjustment for the project was to wrap each recommendation item in a `<figure>` element, both for semantic clarity and for application of some of the project's signature styles such as a gradient and a border radius.

- Taking Damien L Gilliams' LinkedIn CSS styles a steph further, the list of awards featured in `#target-six`'s Awards section in index.html applies Mr. Gilliams' appropriation style to the "Accomplishments" section of the owner's public LinkedIn profile. Code for this extensive `<ul>` was only slightly modified for margins. The CSS rulesets extracted from this exercise are added to the style block following the Recommendations style block and Mr. Gilliams's notes in style.css.

- GitHub's  progress bar styles and language colors were appropriated in the project by inspecting the HTML of the project's repository page, and using the colors it assigns for languages. [MDBootstrap's Progress bar](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/components/progress/) class was then utilized to show these percentages.

- The landing section's "highlighted text" feature uses CSS from [John Negoita's examples](https://medium.com/@codingdudecom/highlight-text-css-97331a5b71b5). Complete descriptions of customization is described in style.css.
