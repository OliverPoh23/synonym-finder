# SynonymSearch


***A *meaningful* thesaurus***

Remember all the words you find when you use a Thesaurus.


SynonymSearch helps you to review what you've just learned (and might otherwise forget) by sorting a list of all your search queries by their shared definitions as you're finding them.

SynonymSearch lets you test the similarity of synonymous words by injecting them into a sentence whose meaning depends on the definition they share. The app helps you actively make sense of a definition and then review it against a repository of synonyms.

<!-- SynonymSearch also always lets you know when you've found a word that you should "already know."  -->

This project is developed as part of MS2 Interactive Front End module at Code Institute. It is written to work with [Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ® Thesaurus](https://dictionaryapi.com/)'s JSON response format, and is developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed with [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

### Design
#### Loose Leaf

- A consistent top and bottom border is applied to all nodes with dynamic content. These discrete borders are designed to convey the material scale of a note pad as a familiar touchpoint to a user. These `wordBoxes` only vary in spacing and are responsible for visually conveying hierarchy in a the ***list of list of lists***.

        Sample Page.

    <br>
    </details>


#### Theme

- Material-UI's `ThemeProvider` wraps the app in order to pass styles down the component tree. See [Material-UI Theming](https://material-ui.com/styles/advanced/#advanced).

#### Typography

- The font family is set to an array of system fonts in order to adapt to device/platform/user configuration and avoid depending on an explicit typeface. A `commonSettings` object in `theme.context.js` contains a list of these overrides, which is merged with Material-UI's theme provider. See [Material-UI Global-css](https://material-ui.com/customization/globals/#global-css)


    <details><summary> commonSettings </summary>
    <br>

     ```jsx
         export const commonSettings = {
          typography: {
            fontFamily: [
              '-apple-system',
              'BlinkMacSystemFont',
              '"Segoe UI"',
              'Roboto',
              '"Helvetica Neue"',
              'Arial',
              'sans-serif',
              '"Apple Color Emoji"',
              '"Segoe UI Emoji"',
              '"Segoe UI Symbol"',
            ].join(','),
          },
      }
     ```

    <br>
    </details>


#### Color

- The app features two sets of primary and secondary colors for a light theme and a dark theme configured via Material UI's [palette configuration](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0). Behaviors and states of colors rely on properties defined in [Material-UI's Default Theme object](https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/#default-theme). Secondary colors are set to neutral tone, while primaries are rendered as the singular "feature color". The minimal approach to color sets is to enhance a notepad


    <details><summary> lightTheme instance </summary>
    <br>

     ```jsx
     const lightTheme = createMuiTheme({
             palette: {
             type: 'light',
             primary: {
              main: '#ff3200',
            },
        secondary: {
              main: grey[900],
            },
        },
      ...commonSettings,
      });

     ```

    <br>
    </details>
  
    <details><summary> darkTheme instance </summary>
    <br>

     ```jsx
     const darkTheme = createMuiTheme({
      palette: {
        type: 'dark',
        primary: {
          main: lightblue[500],
        },
        secondary: {
          main: '#fafafa',
        },
        background: {
          default: '#151515',
        },
      },
      ...commonSettings,
    });

     ```

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Dynamic Page
  - The website is modeled as a progressive web application to render a single-page-app's functionality without full page reloads and optimized to perform like a native app. Its framework ensures flexibility across browsers.

  - The website takes advantage of large floating action buttons (FAB) to quickly navigate between its three remote views: "Search", "Info", and "Saves". Visual metaphors are utilized to represent these view modes discretely and efficiently.

  - A floating "speed dial" button persists across views to quickly access the app's core actions: querying a term, clearing the saved history, and toggling light or dark mode.

  - The app features a custom launch screen on initial page load to succinctly describe its purpose: "An interactive thesaurus app".

#### Info
  - The website offers an info section to credit brands, namely, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus, and supply information about the app.


#### Search / Results
- The application is written to return lists of Synonyms, Related Words, Synonymous Phrases and Similar Words for any queried word in the english language via Thesaurus API. Each word is presented as an option to query.
- ##### Actions:
 -  Ability to see if and how many times a word has been queried before.
 -  Ability to see if and how many words have been queried with the same definition.
 -  Ability to see if and how many definitions queried share the same root.
-  Ability to match definition in a string (See [Verbal Illustration](#-verbal-illustration)).

#### Saves
- The website features the ability to view all previous queries, grouped by their sense definition, accessible via the Saves tab.
- ##### Actions:
-  Ability to remove individual words from the list.
-  Ability to clear the list.

#### Verbal Illustration

- If a definition contains an example sentence, the website displays this as  verbal illustration to feature how a particular word might be used in context.
- On scroll and/or on hover, the word used in the sentence changes to the next word in the list of synonyms.
- ##### Actions:
-  Ability to see a word in a sentence by touch/mouse/scroll event.

### Features Left to Implement

- Ability to deep-merge from a localStorage and/or Apollo Client.
- Ability to manage user search history after browser session.
- Show Anyonyms feature.
- Call random word on initial load from Word Of The Day API.
- "Feeling Lucky" random word query.
- Prevent default refresh on browser refresh.
- Make installable.

## Notes

- Styles are written in [jss](https://cssinjs.org/jss-syntax/?v=v10.5.1) syntax and follow the spec for [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/styles/advanced/#theming) to play nicely with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) Server-side rendering, which includes [this logic](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/examples/nextjs/pages/_document.js) of customizing `pages/_document`  to to inject server-side rendered styles into the markup right before it's used. Note that this is an unofficial recommendation, and should be refactored if/when MUI releases an official plugin for Nextjs similar to the one for [MUI/Gatsby](https://github.com/hupe1980/gatsby-plugin-material-ui).
- All style objects are created with MUI's `makeStyles` hook and follow guidelines in [MUI style Docs](https://material-ui.com/styles/advanced/#makestyles) for theming. This includes CSS overrides and media queries. Style objects for main components are separated by scope in the [styles Directory](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/src/styles/) and imported in modules as required. However, some components, namely, `Launcher`, have all style props declared in the component file itself. Note that all styles should eventually be exported from one directory for consistency.
- The `results` tree renders `jsx` components on every API call without initializing constants. Props and conditional expressions control the iteration of the response schema from MW-Thesaurus API. Note that values and Prop-Type verifications are specifically written to get the right data from this schema:
    <details><summary> Mapping conditionals down the tree </summary>
    <br>

     - Each query has several headWords
          *("about" as preposition, as adverb...)*:
        - Each headWord has several definitions
           *("about" as in to be, "about as in to...)*:
          - Each headWord defined in a particular sense:
            - has A definition.
            - may have A string that uses the word in a sentence ([see Verbal Illustration](#verbal-illustration))
            - may have A list of Synonyms
            - may have A list of Related words
            - may have A list of Synonymous Phrases
            - may have A list of Similar Words

    <br>
    </details>
- Each saved word instance retains properties of the Results family it is "taken" from -- such as the word's particular definition, label, root word -- to increment values of duplicates and group words by sense definitions while ensuring each instance, no matter identical at name value, is distinct if the definition and sense is different
- React hooks `useReducer`, `useContext`, `createContext` are assembled together in `context/words.context` ([see HistoryProvider](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/src/context/words.context.js)) to provide a context wrapper for components to share and consume the same data. Note that this logic is directly modeled from the example set in [next.js/examples/with-context-api](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-context-api).
- Following what is achieved by `HistoryProvider`'s exported context wrapper hooks `useHistory` and `useDispatchHstory` -- which are utilized across higher-order components, shared components and helper functions in `helpers/*` to radically manipulate the DOM -- the same logic is repurposed to ride multiple hooks along a custom wrapper with MUI's ThemeProvider the ([see ThemeProvider](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/src/context/theme.context.js)). In this case, setting the the view value, allows any component to change the page from anywhere, to name a few. Note that the catch-all nature of this Context layout provider.
    <details><summary> All layout states in a Context Theme </summary>
    <br>

    ``` jsx
      export const ThemeContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
      // Sets the theme for MUI ThemeProvider to use
      const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
      // Sets the current view 
      const [value, setValue] = useState('launch');
      // Hooks to set warning colors for searchText input
      const [meta, setMeta] = useState(true);
      const [root, setRoot] = useState('');
      // Rides an MUI hook to set a memoized theme
      const prefersDarkMode = useMediaQuery('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');

      useMemo(

- Using MW-Thesaurus is free for non-commercial and/or educational purposes. Featured brand logos in the info tab is to follow branding guidelines requested by but not limited to Merriam-Webster's Development center.
- The registered Thesaurus API key linked to this project is currently public. Following [this discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/12531), the effort to protect API calls on the client side is aimless as the private key will always be exposed. Further configuration to have an internal endpoint in `/pages/api` should be considered following [Nextjs API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). Note that the key has been exposed from `.env.local` for the reasons above and for the educational purposes of the project.

## Testing
#### Lighthouse
#### [Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, PWA](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Latest Results](https://lighthouse.vercel-lighthouse-integration.now.sh/reports/synonym-chaser-d4oa432xn.vercel.app)
- Lighthouse via Vercel is used to test performace, which produces unique results on every `git push`. [lighthouse-badges](https://github.com/emazzotta/lighthouse-badges) is used to generate new badges for every deployment by installing ```npm i -g lighthouse-badges``` and pushing the new hashed url to the array of urls:

    ```
    lighthouse-badges 
    -o docs/badges -r 
    -u https://synonyms.vercel.app/ [... all other urls]
                       
   # Output to docs/badges
   # Badges will contain the respective
      average score(s) of all the urls 
      supplied, combined
    ```
- Lighthouse's metrics, namely Accessibility and Performance generate specific flags on each audit. Adjustments are made on each push that specifically address any issues. 
  

#### ChromeVox

- [ChromeVox Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) was used to ensure that screen-reader accessibility standards are met. This was done by walking through the entire project with the screen-reader plugin enabled. Various adjustments were made following these tests. Notably, the tab-index order of nav elements, and changing refining HTML5 semantic elements for `role` clarity.

#### Browser Testing

- Throughout the development of the project, in-browser dev tools were used to test for consistency across browsers. The browsers themselves were equally used for general use-case testing. The following browsers' per-device applications were accessed with an iPhone 11 Pro, MacBook Pro 15" and iPad Pro 12.9":
- Chrome Version: 83
- Firefox 82
- Opera 72
- Safari 14

## Deployment

- The project is developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed with [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment), which I achieved with the following steps:
- `commit` and `push` the code from my local IDE to Github via Git and my MacBook Pro's iTerm terminal.
- Log in to Vercel and click the [New Project](https://vercel.com/new) CTA.
- Access "Import Git Repository" via the `select` input, located at the top-left of the immediate prompt.
- Click "Import" on the repository named "synonym-chaser"
- Select the default "Personal Account" along with the default "master" root directory.
- Click "Deploy"
- Barring errors, await the prompt for:
> ##### "Your project has been successfully deployed."
