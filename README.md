## Synonym Chaser App

This app creates a cloud of search inputs out of returned results from an inital query via Thesaurus API. Clicking any of the search-text-buttons adds that word to a list and refreshes the cloud with results from that word, and so on. The result is an interactive Thesaurus experience that tracks a cart of all the words that lead to the current one.

This project is developed as part of MS2 Interactive Front End module at Code Institute. It is developed with React via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
