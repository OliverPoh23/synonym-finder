# SynonymSearch
---

## A *meaningful* thesaurus.

Remember all the words you find when you use a Thesaurus.


SynonymSearch helps you to review what you've just learned (and might otherwise forget) by sorting a list of all your search queries by their shared definitions as you're finding them. 

SynonymSearch lets you test the similarity of synonymous words by injecting them into a sentence whose meaning depends on the definition they share. The app helps you actively make sense of a definition and then review it against a repository of synonyms.

<!-- SynonymSearch also always lets you know when you've found a word that you should "already know."  -->

This project is developed as part of MS2 Interactive Front End module at Code Institute. It is written to work with [Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ® Thesaurus](https://dictionaryapi.com/)'s JSON response format, and is developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed with [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

- ##### Appropriating Precedent


    <br>
    <details><summary> The React App's core functionality can be understood as a <em><b>Products List</b></em> with <em><b>products</b></em> fetched from a <em><b>store</b></em>  and a <em><b>Shopping Cart</b></em> with a list of <em><b>items</b></em> added that  can be removed and/or cleared </summary>

    <br>
    
    <br>
    <details><summary> And the ability to toggle between <em><b>Products List</b></em> and <em><b>Shopping Cart</b></em>   </summary>

[<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/docs/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes20.jpg?raw=true" width="400px"></div>](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/docs/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes20.jpg?raw=true) -->

#### NotePad

- A consistent top and bottom border is applied to all nodes with dynamic content. These discrete borders are designed to convey the material scale of a note pad as a familiar touchpoint to a user. These `wordBoxes` only vary in spacing and are responsible for visually conveying hierarchy in a the ***list of list of lists***.

#### Theme

- Material-UI's `ThemeProvider` wraps the app in order to pass styles down the component tree. See [Material-UI Theming](https://material-ui.com/styles/advanced/#advanced).

##### Typography

- The font family is set to an array of system fonts in order to adapt to device/platform/user configuration and avoid depending on an explicit typeface. A `commonSettings` object in `theme.context.js` contains a list of these overrides, which is merged with Material-UI's theme provider. See [Material-UI Global-css](https://material-ui.com/customization/globals/#global-css)


    <br>
    <details><summary> commonSettings </summary> 
    <br>

     ```
         export const commonSettings = {
          typography: {
            fontFamily: [
              '-apple-system',
              'BlinkMacSystemFont',
              '"Segoe UI"',
              'Roboto',
              '"Helvetica Neue"',
              'Arial',
              'sans-serif',
              '"Apple Color Emoji"',
              '"Segoe UI Emoji"',
              '"Segoe UI Symbol"',
            ].join(','),
          },
      }
     ```

    <br>
    </details> 
    <br>


##### Color

- The app features two sets of primary and secondary colors for a light theme and a dark theme configured via Material UI's [palette configuration](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0). Behaviors and states of colors rely on properties defined in [Material-UI's Default Theme object](https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/#default-theme). Secondary colors are set to neutral tone, while primaries are rendered as the singular "feature color". The minimal approach to color sets is to enhance a notepad



    <br>
    <details><summary> lightTheme instance </summary> 
    <br>

     ```
     const lightTheme = createMuiTheme({
             palette: {
             type: 'light',
             primary: {
              main: '#ff3200',
            },
        secondary: {
              main: grey[900],
            },
        },
      ...commonSettings,
      });

     ```

    <br>
    </details> 
    <br>



    <br>
    <details><summary> darkTheme instance </summary> 
    <br>

        type: 'dark',
        primary: {
          main: lightblue[500],
        },
        secondary: {

        background: {
          default: '#151515',

## Features
___
### Existing Features
___

#### Dynamic Layout SPA
___
  - The website is modeled as a progressive web application to render a single-page-app's functionality without full page reloads and optimized to perform like a native app. Its framework ensures flexibility across browsers. 

  - The website takes advantage of large floating action buttons (FAB) to quickly navigate between its three remote views: "Search", "Info", and "Saves". Visual metaphors are utilized to represent these view modes discretely and efficiently.

  - A floating "speed dial" button persists across views to quickly access the app's core actions: querying a term, clearing the saved history, and toggling light or dark mode.

  - The app features a custom launch screen on initial page load to succinctly describe its purpose: "An interactive thesaurus app".

#### Info 
___
  - The website offers an info section to credit brands, namely, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus, and supply information about the app.
  
       
#### Search / Results
___
###### [View Schematic Results Component Ideation Board](https://github.com/israelias/synonym-chaser/blob/master/docs/wireframes/MS2_Wireframes11.jpg?raw=true)

- The application is written to return lists of Synonyms, Related Words, Synonymous Phrases and Similar Words for any queried word in the english language via Thesaurus API. Each word is presented as an option to query.

    - ##### Actions: 
         -  Ability to see if and how many times a word has been queried before.
         -  Ability to see if and how many words have been queried with the same definition.
         -  Ability to see if and how many definitions queried share the same root.
        -  Ability to match definition in a string (See [Verbal Illustration](#-verbal-illustration)).


#### Saves
___
  - The website features the ability to view all previous queries, grouped by their sense definition, accessible via the Saves tab.
    - ##### Actions: 
       -  Ability to remove individual words from the list.

### Documentation Notes
___

1. The result instance and iterating through the JSON as it is returned,  forking at each array nest every time a new unknown length array has to be iterated .

    <br>
 <details><summary> Example JS </summary> <br>

     ```JavaScript  

 // test  
     ```

  <br>
 </details> <br>

2. Directory follows Vercel documentation but moved to src folder, .

3. _Document custom and serverSide props.
4. The app utilizes Axios to manage responses from the API. The app's Search component is written to auto-cancel in the middle of typing so as to reduce the amount of requests to the API.  The Search component is built from Material-UI input elements and uses State hooks elicit *side-effects* `onSearchTextChange`.
5.  The Results component is written to work specifically with the JSON response from the Thesaurus API.
6. To note, on succinctly representing the API response:
  - Each query has several head-words ("about" as preposition, as adverb...):
    - Each headWord has several definitions ("about" as in to be, "about as in to...):
      - Each headWord defined in a particular way has:
        - A definition.
        - A string that uses the word in a sentence ([see Display String](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment))
        - A list of Synonyms
        - A list of Related words
        - A list of Synonymous Phrases
        - A list of Similar Words
7. Each saved word instance retains properties of the Results family it is "taken" from -- such as the word's particular definition, label, root word -- to increment values of duplicates and group words by sense definitions while ensuring each instance, no matter identical at name value, is distinct if the definition and sense is different
8. Counters Context ( and useReducer ) Text about `wordsHistoryDispatch`
9. Theme Context ( and useMemo, useMediaQuery )Text about theme provider

>*Note: All descriptions of atypical methods can be found within style blocks in style.css.*

### Code Testing
___

- The W3C Markup Validator (Nu Html Checker) and W3C CSS Validator Services continue to be used to validate the single html page (index.html) and the css URI of the project (/assets/style.css) to ensure no errors, alerts or flags pertaining to html and css syntax. Some warnings for "potential misuse of aria-label" were reviewed; the elements that remain are deemed usable and beneficial. See [Accessibility Testing](#accessibility-testing).

    - [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fisraelias.github.io%2Fresume-redux%2Findex.html)

## Credits
___
### Code
___

- Damien L. Gilliams' tutorial on [how to embed LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.damosdesigns.com/LinkedinRecommendationsOnWebsite/) takes care of a whole section in the project, and is a great lesson on appropriation. Directly following Mr. Gilliams' tutorial, the style block for `#target-six`'s Recommendations section in style.css are only slightly modified from the tutorial. This style block includes Mr. Gilliams' original comments.  Equally, the code in index.html for the Recommendations section is taken from the owner's public LinkedIn profile, with adjustments per Mr. Gilliams' tutorial. One adjustment for the project was to wrap each recommendation item in a `<figure>` element, both for semantic clarity and for application of some of the project's signature styles such as a gradient and a border radius.

- Taking Damien L Gilliams' LinkedIn CSS styles a steph further, the list of awards featured in `#target-six`'s Awards section in index.html applies Mr. Gilliams' appropriation style to the "Accomplishments" section of the owner's public LinkedIn profile. Code for this extensive `<ul>` was only slightly modified for margins. The CSS rulesets extracted from this exercise are added to the style block following the Recommendations style block and Mr. Gilliams's notes in style.css.

- GitHub's  progress bar styles and language colors were appropriated in the project by inspecting the HTML of the project's repository page, and using the colors it assigns for languages. [MDBootstrap's Progress bar](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/components/progress/) class was then utilized to show these percentages.

- The landing section's "highlighted text" feature uses CSS from [John Negoita's examples](https://medium.com/@codingdudecom/highlight-text-css-97331a5b71b5). Complete descriptions of customization is described in style.css.
